======

A collection of my tools qwhich I use in several projects

Epo

My own persistence framework. Inherit from Epo or EpoCached, initialize the class and the properties of that class will be persitent,  Works with ORACLE and MS-Access databases.

gui forms (only for win-forms)

*Before you use this, consider to use NHibernate or SQL-Alchemy or another better supported persistence framerwork.*
